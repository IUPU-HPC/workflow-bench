1. modules
    Currently Loaded Modulefiles:
        1) psc_path/1.1      2) slurm/17.02.5     3) git/2.10.2        4) mpi/gcc_mvapich
2. other softwares
    * tau:(include tau-2.26.3 and pdtoolkit)
        * path
            built manually(gcc+mvapich) at "~/Downloads/tau_bundle/"
            installed at ~/env/tau_bundle
        * environment varaibles

            export TAU_MAKEFILE=/home/fli5/envs/tau_bundle/tau/x86_64/lib/Makefile.tau-papi-ompt-mpi-pdt-openmp
            export TAU_OPTIONS="-optRevert"
            export PATH="/home/fli5/envs/tau_bundle/tau/x86_64/bin:/home/fli5/envs/tau_bundle/pdt/x86_64/bin:/home/lifeng/tools/anaconda/bin:$PATH"
    * transport libraries
        * path 
            built in ~/Downloads/transport_bundle_gcc_mvapich/
            install at ~/envs/gcc_mvapich(this will include ADIOSroot, Dataspaceroot, Flexpath)

        * binaries
            a full-feattured binary copy is here: https://github.iu.edu/lifen/transport_binaries
            cp the 3 folders(ADIOSroot, Dataspaceroot Flexpath) to ~/envs/gcc_mvapich, 

    * transport libraries buit using tau
        * path
            built in ~/Downloads/transport_bundle_gcc_mvapich

            installed in "$ENV{WORK}/envs/transports_tau/ 

            this is installed in yuankun's machine,
            (the working version in my machine, I use my machine to get the result) are still scattered to 
                Dataspacesroot_gnu_mvapich
                Flexpath_gnu_mvapich
                ADIOSroot_gnu_mvapioch

        
        * note
            currently I cannot build ADIOS+FLEXPATH+application+DATASPACE all with tau_cc.ssh
            a workaround is for use unstructed Flexpath and build all the other with taucc.
            Somehow instructed ADIOS cannot recoganize instructed ADIOS. But we didn;t show the
            trace to ADIOS/DIMES, this should be fine
             



## build
    if buiding for Stampede2, please add corresponding avx CFLAGS
    if getting warning of not finding libraries evpath,ffs,atl,dill, cercs_env, please append Flexpath library path to LD_LIBRARY_PATH

    *added in Oct 26
        now compiler and transport library path are automatically confgiured using CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE

    to build in stampede:
    ```
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    ```

    build with tau trace support
    ```
    mkdir build_tau && cd build_tau
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Stampede_TAU ..
    ```

    build in bridges
    ```
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Bridges ..
    ```
