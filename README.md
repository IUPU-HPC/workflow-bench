Benchmarking I/O transport libraries with in-situ workflows.

This repository includes code/scripts used in our HPDC18 paper[1] to configure, launch, instrument, evaluate in-situ workflows.

Some highlights are:
* Different transport libraries such as MPI-IO, FlexPath, ADIOS, DataSpaces, DIMES and Decaf are compared.
* Two insitu workfow setups (both simulation and analysis application are MPI-based parallel applications):
  - LBM (Lattice Boltzmann method) + n-th moments analysis.
  - LAMMPS + MSD (mean squared displacement) analysis
* TAU and Intel ITAC are used to instrument both simulation and analysis code and generate traces.
* Slurm job scripts to launch experiments on PSC Bridges and TACC Stampede2.
